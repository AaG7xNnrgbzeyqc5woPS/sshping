=head1 NAME

sshping - measure character-echo latency and bandwidth for an interactive ssh session

=head1 SYNOPSIS

sshping [options] [user@]addr[:port]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<sshping> is an SSH-based ping-like utility that measures interactive character echo latency
and file transfer upload/download throughput.  It's pronounced "shipping".

=head1 PARAMETERS

user
    Username for the login to the remote system.
    If omitted, it defaults to the current username on the
    local system.

addr
    IP name or address of the target system.

port
    tcp port number for the ssh daemon on the target system.
    This must be a number, service names like "ssh" are not supported.
    Default is 22.

=head1 OPTIONS

Short and long forms of options take the same arguments as shown.

-b, --bindaddr IP
    Bind to this source address

-c, --count NCHARS
    Number of characters to echo, default 1000

-d, --delimited
    Use delmiters in big numbers, eg 1,234,567

-e, --echocmd CMD
    Use CMD for echo command; default: cat > /dev/null
    For the character echo test, this command is issued to the
    remote system (sshping adds the newline) so that anything
    "typed" is echoed back.

-h,  --help
    Print usage and exit

-i, --identity FILE
    Identity file, ie ssh private keyfile

-p, --password PWD
    Use password PWD (can be seen, use with care)

-r, --runtests e|s
    Run these tests e=echo s=speed; default es=both

-s, --size MB
    For transfer speed test (the scp test), send MB megabytes; 
    default=8 MB

-t, --time SECS
    Time limit for echo test.  We'll stop the test soon after 
    this number of seconds, or the --couont number of characters, 
    whichever comes first.
    Timing starts after the ssh login and shell creation.

-v, --verbose
    Show more output, use twice for lots: -vv

-z, --target PATH
    Target location for scp upload speed test; default=/dev/null
    A 1MB dummy file is repeatedly copied to this location to test
    the transfer speed.


=head1 OUTPUT FIELDS

=head2 Connection

ssh-Login-Time
    Time in nanoseconds to establish the tcp network connection, 
    authenticate, and form the ssh session, then start an ssh 
    channel, launch a remote shell, login to the remote system 
    and read back any logon banners. 

    If an interactive password is needed to login, the time to supply 
    the password is included as well - so type fast!

=head2 Character Echo Tests

The I<character echo test> issues a single byte to the remote system,
then waits for it to be echoed back.  It checks that the returned character
is correct, then notes the wallclock time elapsed for the round-trip.  
This is repeated with a different character until either the test time limit
is expired or the character count limit is reached.

Since only a subset of the printable ASCII character set is used, 
bytes == characters.

Minimum-Latency
    Fastest (lowest) round-trip time for a character echo, 
    in nanoseconds.

Median-Latency
    The median round-trip time for a character echo.  The median is
    not the same as the average; think of this as the "typical" 
    latency.  You probably want this number when you think average.

Average-Latency
    The average (mean) round-trip time for a character echo, 
    in nanoseconds.

Average-Deviation
    The standard deviation on the average latency.  It quantifies
    how varied the latency is for each character's echo.  A lower
    number indicates a tighter grouping of latencies, a 
    higher number indicates more variation in the latencies.
    "One" standard deviation is the average plus or minus this amount.

Maximum-Latency
    The slowest (highest) round-trip time for a character echo, 
    in nanoseconds.

Echo-Count
    The number of bytes echoed during the test.

=head2 Transfer Speed Test

The file transfer I<speed test> measures the upload and
download throughput rate, in bytes per second (Bps),
using the scp subsystem.  This is the subsystem typically used
when copying files over ssh.

For the upload tests, a random 1MB file is copied to
the target system ("uploads" it), measuring the time required
for the transfer.  The file is repeatedly copied to get transfer 
sizes greater than 1MB.  By default the target file is /dev/null
but this can be changed with --target if you really want to hit
the disk.


Upload-Size
    Number of bytes uploaded during the test.

Upload-Rate
    Throughput speed for the upload transfer, in Bytes/second.
